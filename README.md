# 🔊 4chan WebM Auto-Unmute

Automatically unmutes all WebM videos on 4chan.  
No more clicking sound icons — WebMs just play with sound.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔈 Auto-unmutes every `<video>` on 4chan boards
- 🧠 Detects dynamically loaded WebMs too (e.g. new replies)
- 🎯 Lightweight and seamless

## 🧠 How It Works

- Uses a `MutationObserver` to watch for newly added WebMs
